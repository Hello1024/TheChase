#Frogger#
[Play it here](http://nate.tarrh.website/frogger/).

A working version of Frogger playable in the browser, implemented with JavaScript.

All basic scoring methods are present, and the player recieves an additional life when 10,000 points are scored with fewer than 4 frogs left. Frogger moves on canvas using UP, DOWN, LEFT, and RIGHT arrow keys. If frogger collides with a vehicle or water, he loses a life. 

A leveling system is included that speeds up the cars after 5 frogs have been jumped home.
