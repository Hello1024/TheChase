PRISON RUNNER: THE CHASE

HOW TO PLAY

You have escaped from prison and are on the run from the police.

Use the arrow keys, or swipe, to move around the screen. Every time a word blocks your path, you have 5 seconds to transcribe what you see. 

For every word you write correctly, the police move further away. If you get a word wrong, they step closer.

See how long you can stay on the run!


TRANSCRIPTIONS

Remember to pay attention to capital letters and spelling - they might not be as you'd expect. Transcriptions must be accurate!

Most images show one word, but some show two. Transcribe every full word that you see.

Be careful of letter shapes that have changed over time: 's' can sometimes look like 'f', 't' is not always crossed, and capital 'I', 'J' and 'T' can all look similar.

Points are awarded for correct answers. Some words will be new transcriptions, and these will help us improve our document transcriptions for future researchers.


ABOUT THE MANUSCRIPTS:

The word images you see in this game have been taken from Home Office Criminal Entry Books (HO 13) held at The National Archives.

These books date from 1782-1871 and record out-going correspondence, warrants and pardons. The new transcriptions that you provide in this game will help create full transcriptions of these documents, revealing the lives of 18th - 19th century prisoners.
